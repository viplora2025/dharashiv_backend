Backend Changes Summary (2026-02-06)

API Endpoint Changes
- Complaints: create complaint endpoint changed from POST /api/complaints/complaints to POST /api/complaints
- Complainers: by-taluka endpoint changed from /api/complainers/complainers/by-taluka/:talukaId to /api/complainers/by-taluka/:talukaId
- Events: /api/events/limited/events now reachable (route order fixed). Path unchanged.
- Auth: refresh-token and logout no longer require access token. Use refresh token only.

Behavior / Auth Changes
- Complainers by user or by user+taluka: if role is user, access is restricted to own userId.
- Admin get-by-id now requires admin role (not just any authenticated user).

Other Backend Fixes (no frontend change needed)
- Socket.IO auth middleware order fixed.
- Complaint chat media type now sets pdf as "pdf" and staff role allowed in complaint history.
- Department update now only updates provided fields (no accidental clears).
- Event ID generation length normalized.
- src/index.js import paths fixed for serverless entry.
